However, this right does not apply in particular if the processing is necessary to exercise the right to freedom of expression and information, to fulfill a legal obligation, for reasons of public interest or to assert, exercise or defend legal claims;</li>
                <li><strong>Right to restriction of processing in accordance with Art. 18 GDPR:</strong> You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data as long as the accuracy of your data, which you dispute, is being checked, if you refuse to delete your data because of inadmissible data processing and instead request the restriction of the processing of your data if you need your data to assert, exercise or defend legal claims after we no longer need this data after the purpose has been achieved or if you have lodged an objection for reasons of your particular situation, as long as it is not yet clear whether our legitimate reasons prevail;</li>
                <li><strong>Right to information in accordance with Art. 19 GDPR:</strong> If you have asserted the right to correction, deletion or restriction of processing against the person responsible, he is obliged to inform all recipients to whom the personal data concerning you have been disclosed of this correction or deletion of the data or restriction of processing, unless this proves impossible or involves a disproportionate effort.

                <li><strong>Right to lodge a complaint pursuant to Art. 77 GDPR:</strong> If you believe that the processing of your personal data violates the GDPR, you have - without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy - the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State where you live, work or where the alleged infringement took place.</li>
